## Prompt

Your task is to determine if the student's solution is correct or not. <br/>
To solve the problem do the following:
- First, work out your own solution to the problem. 
- Then compare your solution to the student's solution and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. 
Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until you have done the problem yourself.

Explanation:<br/>
The student's solution did not take into account the additional $10 per square foot for maintenance cost. Therefore, the total cost should be 360x + 100,000 instead of 450x + 100,000.

### ChatGPT-3.5 Legacy
The student's solution is correct. The total cost of the first year of operations can be represented by the equation: 450x + 100,000, where x is the size of the installation in square feet. This takes into account the cost of the land, solar panels, and maintenance, as described in the problem statement.

The land costs $100 per square foot, so the cost of the land would be 100x.<br/>
The solar panels cost $250 per square foot, so the cost of the solar panels would be 250x.<br/>
The maintenance costs a flat $100,000 per year, plus an additional $10 per square foot, so the cost of the maintenance would be 100,000 + 100x.<br/>
Adding up these three costs gives us the total cost of 450x + 100,000.

Sure, I can help you with that.

**Question:**

I'm building a solar power installation and I need help working out the financials.

-   Land costs $100 / square foot
-   I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
-   I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square foot

What is the total cost for the first year of operations as a function of the number of square feet.

**Student's solution:**

Code snippet

```
Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.

Costs:

1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x

Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000
```

Use code with caution. [Learn more](https://bard.google.com/faq#coding)

**Actual solution:**

The student's solution is correct. The total cost for the first year of operations as a function of the number of square feet is 450x + 100,000.

Here are the steps to work out the solution:

1.  Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
2.  The land cost is 100x.
3.  The cost of the solar panels is 250x.
4.  The maintenance cost is 100,000 + 10x.
5.  The total cost is 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 10x = 450x + 100,000.

Therefore, the student's solution is correct.

To determine if the student's solution is correct, let's work out the problem ourselves:

Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.

Costs:
1. Land cost: $100 / square foot * x square feet = $100x
2. Solar panel cost: $250 / square foot * x square feet = $250x
3. Maintenance cost: $100,000 + $10 / square foot * x square feet = $100,000 + $10x

Total cost: $100x + $250x + $100,000 + $10x = $360x + $100,000
